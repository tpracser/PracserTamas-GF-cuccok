You have to solve only one problem, that is assigned to you. Please don't use
direct built in functions for the given problem like: reverse, count, indexOf, groupBy, split, join, etc...


## 1.

Create a function that takes a matrix (list of lists) of numbers and sums all the numbers.

## 2.
Create a function that reverses a string

## 3.
Create a function that determines if a string is a palindrome

## 4.
Create a function that returns how many letters in the word: "duck" (it is four)

## 5.
Create a function that takes two arrays and decides if their content is the same

## 6.
Create a function that takes a number returns a matrix (list of lists) with height and width as the number,
all of it's elments should be zero, beside the main diagonal should be ones like:
```
1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1
```

## 7.
Create a function that takes a string and a letter, than returns a list that contains all the
indexes where the letter occured in the string.

## 8.
Create a function that takes two arrays and mixes them like this:
`[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 8]` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8]`

## 9.
Create a function that takes an array of integers and retunrs the biggest from each of its second elements like:
`[1, 3, 8, 6, 7, 4]` would return 6

## 10.
Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns the average of the even numbers from that array

## 11.
Create a function that takes two strings and decides if one is anagram of the other

## 12.
Create a function that takes a matrix (list of lists) of numbers and returns the sum of each rows as an array

## 13.
Create a function that takes a list of strings and transforms it like:

```
[
  "abc",
  "ijk",
  "xyz"
]
```

becomes

```
[
  "aix",
  "bjy",
  "ckz"
]
```

## 14.
Create a function takes a string and a letter and splits the string to an list of strings by the letter like:
`"a,bcd,e,fg"` and `','` becomes `["a", "bcd", "e", "fg"]`

## 15.
Create a function that takes a string and splits it to a list of two character strings like:
`"abcdef"` becomes `["ab", "cd", "ef"]`

## 16.
Create a function that takes a list of strings and a letter and returns a string where the strings are joined with the given letter like:
`["ab", "cde", "fg"]` and `" "` becomes `"ab cde fg"`

## 17,
Create a function that takes an array and a number and shifts the values of the array by the given number like:
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `2` becomes `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`

## 18.
Create a function that takes two strings and returns an array of characters that consitst all the common letters of the two arrays

## 19.
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where all the duplicate values are removed

## 20.
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second biggest element from it

## 21.
Create a function that takes two list of numbers and returns a new list that only consists those numbers that are in the first array but not in the second

## 22
Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new one consisting only those numbers that occured minimum twice in the original array
